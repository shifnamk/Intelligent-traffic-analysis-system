Traffic Image Classification Model README
Overview
Welcome to the Traffic Image Classification Model! This model is designed to classify traffic images into three categories: sparse traffic, dense traffic, and incidents (fire and accidents). It utilizes the VGG16 architecture for image classification.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using the model, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (version 3.6 or later)
TensorFlow (version 2.0 or later)
Keras (version 2.2.0 or later)

Model Details
Architecture
The model is based on the VGG16 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network designed for image classification. The pre-trained weights for VGG16 have been used, and the model has been fine-tuned on a traffic image dataset.

Classes
The model can classify images into the following classes:

Sparse Traffic
Dense Traffic
Incident (Fire and Accident)
